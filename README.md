# DAAD_Scrapping

This repository has four notebooks
  - scrapping_DAAD
  - DAAD Data Cleaning
  - Feautre_Engineering_DAAD
  - DAAD_Data_Visualization

The main objective in this project was learning how to scrape information from the web, how to clean it, how to modify some features and doing some visualization to extract useful information.

The data base scrapped from the DAAD is not in this repository, because the purpose of this project is personal with an academic intention.
