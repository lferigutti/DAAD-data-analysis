# German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) analysis project




## Introduction
**German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)** is the most important organization in Germany when someone wants to study in that country. It has a large database with all the different international programs to study there.

### Files
This repository has four notebooks:
* scrapping_DAAD
* DAAD Data Cleaning
* Feautre_Engineering_DAAD
* DAAD_Data_Visualization

## Project
In this project, I scraped that database using python, mainly the library **'beautiful soup'**. The code is in the file scrapping_DAAD). Once I got all the information that I needed, I **cleaned the data** to be able to analyze it more efficiently. In addition, I did some **feature engineering** to extract useful information from the raw data.

In the last notebook, I did an **exploratory analysis** to understand the different academic offers in each state. I realized that every state has completely different options of budgets, programs, and type of study.

Finally, I create also a [dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/leonardo.ferigutti/viz/DAAD_Data_Visualization/Dashboard1) in **Tableau**, where I resume the most important insights that I found during the exploratory analysis. 
 



*Note*: The database scraped from the DAAD is not in this repository, because the purpose of this project is personal with an academic intention.
